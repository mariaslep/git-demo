The sirens keep on screaming, that's a warning
We're staring at the ticket that says "one trip"
No turning back, hold tight onto them railings
It's only us, but something's saying (More, please) 

Yeah, this train never sleeps
Brace yourself, take a seat
Don't you care about the casualties, casualties
'Cause it's safe when it's just you and me, you and me

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, I feel our heartbeats
Shaking, trembling
Rough ride, hold on tight
Yeah, this train never sleeps
